# Simple Live Reload

This is a simple live reload server that serves `index.html` and detects changes inside of any `.js` and `.css` files inside of the assets folder. This means no longer needing to refresh your browser to see changes!

It also features Mocha, Chai, and Sinon for easily including tests.

To start:

```
npm install
```

Then:

```
npm start
```
